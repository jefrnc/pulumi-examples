# vault-py-create-approle

This is a Pulumi stack that demonstrates how to use the Vault AppRole to authenticate Jenkins with Vault.

## Prerequisites

- Pulumi CLI (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- HashiCorp Vault (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install)
  
## Configuration

```ssh
export VAULT_ADDRESS=<VAULT_ADDRESS>
export VAULT_TOKEN=<VAULT_TOKEN>
```

## Execution

Deploy the Pulumi stack:

```ssh
pulumi up
````

## Retrieve the role ID and secret ID from Vault

```ssh
role_name="jenkins-dev-role"
role_id=$(curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/approle/role/$role_name/role-id  | jq -r .data.role_id)
secret_id=$(curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" --request POST $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/approle/role/$role_name/secret-id | jq -r .data.secret_id)

echo "role_id: $role_id"
echo "secret_id: $secret_id"
```
